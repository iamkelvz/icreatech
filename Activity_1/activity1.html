Introduction to HTML

Objective: The goal of this assignment is to introduce you to the basics of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and its structure. You will create a simple web page using HTML to demonstrate your understanding of various HTML elements.

Instructions:

Create a new HTML file named "index.html" using any text editor or HTML editor of your choice.

Set up the basic structure of an HTML document with the following elements:
HTML5 doctype declaration
<html> tag
<head> and <body> tags

Inside the <head> section, include the following elements:
<title> tag with a descriptive title for your web page.
<meta> tag with the "charset" attribute set to "UTF-8" to ensure proper character encoding.

In the <body> section, create the following content:
A main heading <h1> with a title for your web page.
A paragraph <p> introducing yourself and explaining the purpose of the page.
An unordered list <ul> containing at least three items related to your interests or hobbies.

Add images to your web page:
Create a folder named "images" in the same directory as your HTML file.
Download or use three images related to your interests or hobbies and save them in the "images" folder.
Insert the images using the <img> tag, specifying the correct file path.
Add a link to an external website:
Find an interesting website related to one of your hobbies or interests.
Create a hyperlink using the <a> tag, linking to the external website.

Use at least two different HTML formatting elements, such as <strong>, <em>, <u>, or <blockquote>, to stylize specific parts of your content.

Validate your HTML code:
Use an online HTML validator (e.g., W3C Markup Validation Service) to check for any syntax errors or issues in your code.
Make any necessary corrections to ensure your HTML is valid.

Save your "index.html" file and ensure that all linked resources, such as images, are correctly placed in the appropriate folders.

Submission Guidelines:

Once you have completed the assignment, submit the "index.html" file along with any additional folders and files (such as the "images" folder) in a zip archive or share a GitHub repository link containing your solution.

Note: Don't forget to test your web page in different browsers to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. Good luck!
